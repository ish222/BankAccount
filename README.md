# BankAccount
Bank system using OOP and databases. 
After finishing this project (at least so far), I've learnt many new things: OOP, database queries, writing programs using multiple files among others...
This was my largest project to date, by far. I could imporve this in many ways especially its structure. Near the end of the project, I realised I should've made new files for differented classes to improve the code's structure. I will definitely be aiming to improve this in future projects.
I plan to come back to this project once I learn PyQt5 and add a GUI for better user experience.
